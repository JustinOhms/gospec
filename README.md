GoSpec
======

GoSpec is a [BDD](http://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd)-style testing framework for the [Go programming language](http://golang.org/). It allows writing self-documenting tests/specs, and executes them concurrently and safely isolated.

Source code is available at <http://github.com/orfjackal/gospec>

For discussion, use the [golang-nuts mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts), at least until GoSpec has so many users that it requires its own mailing list. You may also contact GoSpec's developer, [Esko Luontola](http://github.com/orfjackal), by email.


Quick Start
-----------

First you must have Go installed on your machine, as instructed in [Installing Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).


### Install and Update

Checkout GoSpec's source code from its Git repository and install it. The `release` branch is checked out by default.

    git clone git://github.com/orfjackal/gospec.git
    cd gospec/src
    make install

When new versions of GoSpec are released, you can update it by pulling the latest version (from the `release` branch) and then installing it as above.

    git pull
    make install


### Running Specs

You can use the [gotest command](http://golang.org/cmd/gotest/) to run GoSpec's specs. The integration with gotest requires a couple of lines of boilerplate. Basically you will need to create a gotest test method, where you list all your specs and call GoSpec. See [all_specs_test.go] in the [examples] directory for an example.

    func TestAllSpecs(t *testing.T) {
        r := gospec.NewRunner()
        r.AddSpec("SomeSpec", SomeSpec)
        r.AddSpec("AnotherSpec", AnotherSpec)
        // ...
        gospec.MainGoTest(r, t)
    }

See [gotest's documentation](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#Testing) for instructions on how to use gotest.

GoSpec adds one additional parameter to gotest. Use the `-print-all` parameter to print a list of all specs. By default only the failing specs are printed. The list of all specs can be useful as documentation.


### Writing Specs

Because of using gotest, all your specs must be in files whose names end with `_test.go` and they must be added to your test suite as explained above.

Each group of specs is a method which takes `gospec.Context` as a parameter. You can call the methods on `Context` to declare expectations and nested specs.

For examples on how to write specs, see the files in the [examples] directory.

- [stack_test.go] is an example of how you might write a spec for the class in [stack.go].

- [fib_test.go] is an example of how you might write a spec for the class in [fib.go].

- [expectation_examples_test.go] explains the syntax for writing expectations.

- [execution_model_test.go] explains GoSpec's runtime model, for example how the specs are isolated from each other and executed concurrently.

Version History
---------------

**1.x.x (2010-xx-xx)**

*UPGRADE NOTES:* In all your specs, replace `*gospec.Context` with `gospec.Context` in the spec's parameters.

- Upgraded to Go release.2010-02-04

- Initial release


Project Goals
-------------

The following are *a must*, because they enable using [specification-style](http://blog.orfjackal.net/2010/02/three-styles-of-naming-tests.html) the way I prefer:

- **Unlimited Nesting** - The specs can be organized into a nested hierarchy. This makes it possible to apply [One Assertion Per Test](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=35578) which [isolates the reason for a failure](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html), because the specs are very fine-grained. Many unit testing tools allow only 2 levels of nesting (e.g. JUnit), but for specification-style at least 3 levels are needed (e.g. JDave), and once you have 3 levels you might as well implement unlimited levels with the same abstraction.

- **Isolated Execution** - The specs must be [isolated from the side-effects](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html) of their sibling specs. Each spec will see only the side-effects of its parent specs. In effect, the parent specs work similar to the "before" (and "after") test code in many test frameworks, and *by default* none of the specs can see its siblings (there will be a way to override the default). Without this isolation, it would be harder to write reliable side-effect free specs, which in turn would force the specs to be organized differently than what was desired.

- **No Forced Words** - [Getting the words right](http://behaviour-driven.org/GettingTheWordsRight) was the starting point for BDD, so it is absurd that almost all of the BDD frameworks force the programmer to use fixed words (describe, it, should, given, when, then etc.) which incline the programmer to write spec names as sentences which begin or end with those words. You should be able to choose yourself the best possible words that fit a situation. GoSpec uses the syntax `c.Specify("name", ...)` for all levels in the specs, which leads to the word `Specify` becoming *background noise*, so that you ignore it and it does not force you to start your sentences with any particular word (using a meaningless word such as "Spec" would also be a good choice, as long as it is easy to pronounce when communicating with others).

The following are *nice-to-haves*, which make it more pleasant to use the framework:

- **Plain Text Names** - You can use any Unicode characters in the spec names, because they are declared as strings. Using only those characters that are allowed in method names would be too limiting and hard to read.

- **Fluent API** - The syntax for writing specs should be easily readable. It should be obvious that what an assert does, and which is the *expected* and which the *actual* value. Also writing the specs should be easy, requiring as little syntax as possible, but readability has always higher priority than writability.

- **Parallel Execution** - Running the specs [quickly](http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/first.html) (i.e. less than 10-20 seconds) is a must for using TDD, so being able to take advantage of all processing power is important, and multiple CPU cores is the only way to go fast in the foreseen future. GoSpec executes the specs using as much concurrency as possible (one goroutine for each leaf spec), so that it would be possible to utilize all available CPU cores (just remember to set GOMAXPROCS).
